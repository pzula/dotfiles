# Ocean theme for Terminal.app

<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/98681/5622107/93364f60-94f2-11e4-9deb-7b1476b50b52.png" width="762">

This is a quick Terminal.app profile (color scheme) for OS X based on the [base16 Ocean theme](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/#ocean). I couldn't find one in the official repo, so I hastily made my own. 

A little about base16:

> Base16 provides carefully chosen syntax highlighting and a default set of sixteen colors suitable for a wide range of applications.

## iTerm

## Usage

1. Download this repo.
2. Open up Terminal, go to **Preferences**, then **Profiles**.
3. In the bottom left, click the settings cog and select **Import...**. Navigate to the download file and open it.
4. Lastly, set it as your default by selecting the new profile and clicking the **Default** button.

## Terminal prompt

Curious about my Terminal prompt (the arrow, path, and Git info)? Snag it from my `.bash_profile` in my [mdo/config](https://github.com/mdo/config) repo. [Here's what you'd need](https://github.com/mdo/config/blob/master/.bash_profile#L1-L13)â€”just copy, paste, and relaunch your Terminal.
